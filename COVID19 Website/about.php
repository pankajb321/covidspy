  <p class="text" id="readless">Increasing numbers of confirmed diagnoses, including in health care professionals, has indicated that
    from person-to-person spread of SARS CoV-2 is occuring. The production number(i.e the average number of cases a
    single case generates over a course of its infectious period) <span id="dots">....</span><span class="moreText" id="readmore"> is currently estimated to be between 1.4 to 2.5,
    meaning that each infected individual could affect between 1.4 to 2.5 people.
    Similarly to other common respiratory tract infections, MERS and SARS are spread by respiratory droplets producedby
    an infected person when they sneeze or cough.Measures to guard against the infection work under the current
    assumption that SARS CoV-2 present in the same manner.</span>&nbsp; <span><button class="read-more-btn" id = "read" onclick="Read()">Read More</button></span></p>

  <i class="fa fa-bug fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i><span class="about-content">What are the symptoms?</span>
  <p class="text" id="readless1">People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to 
    severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:&nbsp;
     <span id="dots1">....</span><span class="moreText" id="readmore1"> Fever or chills
<br>	• Cough
<br>	• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

<br>	• New loss of taste or smell
<br>	• Sore throat
<br>	• Congestion or runny nose

<i class="fa fa-bug fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i><span class="about-content">How COVID19 is diagnosed?</span>
  <p class="text" id="readless2">COVID-19 can be diagnosed similarly to other conditions caused by viral infections: using a blood, saliva, or tissue sample.

However, most tests use a cotton swab to retrieve a sample from the inside of your nostrils.

Locations that conduct tests include: &nbsp;<span id="dots2">....</span>
  <span class="moreText" id="readmore2"> 
<br>  • The CDC
<br>	• Some state health departments
<br>	• Commercial companies

<br>	• Clinics
<br>	• Emergency rooms
<br>	• Community testing centers</span>&nbsp; <span><button class="read-more-btn" id = "read2" onclick="Read2()">Read More</button></span></p>

<i class="fa fa-bug fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i><span class="about-content">What treatments are available?</span>
  <p class="text" id="readless3">There’s currently no cure for an infection with the new coronavirus. However, many treatments and vaccines are currently under study.

On October 22, 2020, the FDA Trusted Source approved its first COVID-19 treatment, the medication remdesivir (Veklury).
 &nbsp;<span id="dots3">....</span>
  <span class="moreText" id="readmore3">It’s available by prescription for people ages 12 years and older who’ve been hospitalized.
  In November 2020, the FDA also granted EUAs to monoclonal antibody medications. 
  These medications are:
<br>	• Bamlanivimab, from Eli Lilly
<br>	• Casirivimab and imdevimab, which must be administered together, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals</span>&nbsp; <span><button class="read-more-btn" id = "read3" onclick="Read3()">Read More</button></span></p>

<i class="fa fa-bug fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i><span class="about-content">Why is COVID-19 so dangerous?</span>
  <p class="text" id="readless4">Although scientists won’t know for sure until testing becomes widespread, COVID-19 could be about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu, which leads to death in about 0.1% of those it infects, says Donald N. Forthal, MD, 
    professor of medicine and molecular biology and biochemistry, and chief of infectious diseases at UCI School of Medicine.&nbsp;<span id="dots4">...</span>
  <span class="moreText" id="readmore4">This virus also attacks the lower respiratory tract — the bronchial tubes and the lungs — where it can lead to pneumonia. You not only get severe damage to the lungs, which may or may not be directly attributable to the virus,” says Forthal. 
  “But the cytokine storm also can contribute to coagulopathy [clot formation], kidney damage and heart damage. This is what’s causing some people to become severely ill or die, Forthal says. Researchers have seen other coronaviruses provoke similar cytokine overreactions.
